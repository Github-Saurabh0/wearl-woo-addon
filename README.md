##  How It Works

This addon follows a **modular class-based structure**, separating admin and public functionality:

- **`WWA_Core`** – Main plugin loader (handles hooks, init)
- **`WWA_Admin`** – Handles backend settings, menus, and admin scripts
- **`WWA_Public`** – Handles frontend styles, scripts, and WooCommerce customizations
- **`WWA_Activator` / `WWA_Deactivator`** – Handle activation/deactivation events

You can easily extend this with:
- Custom checkout fields  
- Product page modifications  
- REST API endpoints  
- Custom order status automation  

---
